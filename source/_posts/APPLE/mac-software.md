[![software](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gevar321tlj30yt0u0dud.jpg)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ci4y147wq/)

### Command Line Tool

[CLI useful tools](../Command-Line-Tool)

### markdown

1. [**typora**](https://typora.io)

	*See what you write*

	It was the best markdown editor before I used vim

	I still write markdown in Chinese by typora these days

	* advantage

		1. real-time rendering

		2. searching system

		3. various [theme](http://theme.typora.io) and keep updating

		4. beautiful [HomePage](https://typora.io) beyond description

		5. **free** and **open source** (Here is its [github page](https://github.com/typora))

2. **iPic** (with iPic Mover)

	A way to upload my pictures and use links in markdown instead of saving them which annoys me a lot

	* advantage

		1. **free** for basis

		2. **convenient** when using typora (only with *one* click)

		3. slight

	Now there is an app **iPic Mover** which would upload all the pictures in the directory

	Let's give it a try

3. <span id="vim">**vim**</span>

	I also use VIM to write markdown file

	vim will better it to a higher level

	You can see how I use vim to write markdown through my [*vimrc*](../vim/vim.html) and [*usage of vim*](../vim/vim.html)

> why I abandon Bear Pro
>
> 1. the only advantage of it -> auto placing images
>
>		but I use iPic and typora instead
>
> 2. bugs but never fixed
>
> 3. if you know suckless...
>
> 4. without LaTex support
>
> 5. adjust without freedom
>
> 6. not free

### code developer

1. Termianl

	I have moved all my coding work here

	1. **vim**

	2. **git**

		vim + git to organize my configration and study notes (also this website)

		I could view my notes as long as I sign in my gitee

	3. on my zsh

		plugins:

		1. git

		2. zsh-autosuggestion

		3. web-search

	4. <span id="ranger">**ranger**</span>

		an awesome file system in terminal

		of course *finder* is awesome enough

		ranger runs in Terminal

		which means that

		1. go to **path** more easily

		2. use **commands** to do almost all tasks

		3. **bulkrename**

		4. a more convenient way to **show hidden files**

		5. **vim like** `hjkl` and others

		6. some more

2. Xcode

	Beyond comparison but too large

	Still **the best IDE**

3. VScode

	As a saying goes, vscode is the best `IDE` in the whole universe :)

	But I find that it seems unavailable of its **debug* in Calatina

### download


1. *Folx pro*

	Better than any downloader else except aria2 (have not tried)

2. [**Nutstore**](https://www.jianguoyun.com)

	*Double insurance* for notes and just a way to transform files

3. [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com)

	Large storage

	All those sharings are stored on BaiduNetdisk, or I would not touch every produce by Baidu

### tools

1. [**Google Translation**](https://github.com/MoeFE/GoogleTranslate)

	a menu bar tool for google translation

	*useful & deserve downloading*

2. **Hidden Bar**

	no need to pay for *Bartender*

	download in *mac app store*

3. NTFS for mac

	free on [*seagate*](https://www.seagate.com/cn/zh/)!!!

### chat

These two apps published by Tecent are *rubbish* enough

I would never touch them if possible
