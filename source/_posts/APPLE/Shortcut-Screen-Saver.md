{% note warning %}

If asked how to start your screen saver on your mac, what is your answer? Some of you may respond with *Hot Corners*. But it may be the second choice on mine

## Hot Coners

```
Preference -> Desktop & Screen Saver -> Hot Corners
```

Choice one of the four corners and `Start Screen Saver`

## Automator

```
Automator -> New Document -> Quick Action -> Start Screen Saver -> Workflow receives: no input -> save
```

then give your workflow a shortcut

```
Preference -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services
```

I record `control + option + command + s` for screen saver, which is also known as `hybrid + s`

{% note info %}

Recommend:
Fliqlo -- a clock screen saver
4K video -- downloaded from apple TV screen saver
